# Sentiment_Analysis
This work is done as the graduation project. I can't share the dataset as I don't own the copyrights.
In this project, the sentiment (positive or negative) of a statement is found, using a combination of methods like negation handling, mutual information and feature selection besides the Laplacian Smoothing method for improving the accuracy of classification.
Lastly, the accuracy of the model is found.
